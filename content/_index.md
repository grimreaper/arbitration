# Non Supreme Court Federal Cases

## Zenia Chavarria v. Ralphs Grocery Company, 733 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2013)

Pull Quote (from court staff summary):

> The policy was procedurally unconscionable because it was a condition of applying for employment and was presented on a “take it or leave it” basis. In addition, its terms were not provided to the plaintiff until three weeks after she had agreed to be bound by it.
> Specifically, the policy’s arbitrator selection process would always produce an arbitrator proposed by the defendant in employee-initiated arbitration proceedings; the policy precluded institutional arbitration administrators, which have established rules and procedures to select a neutral arbitrator; and the policy’s arbitrator-fee-apportionment provision would have the effect of pricing employees out of the dispute resolution process
