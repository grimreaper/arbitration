# Possible Solutions

The [Basic Problems]({{< relref "problems" >}}) lays out the (mostly) uncontroversial and well sourced problems of mandatory arbitration agreements and class-action waivers. This page seeks to lay out the possible solutions: legislative or judicial.

# Carving Out More Exceptions

# Overturning Southland Corp. v. Keating

# Overturning Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson

# Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams

A simple fix to much of this mess would be remove the words `seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of` in 9 U.S.C. ยง1. This would effectively overturn [Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams]({{< relref "arbitration_legal#circuit-city-v-adams" >}}) and thus eliminate arbitration from the equation in matters of _employment_.

I am somewhat surprised that I've not seen anyone else suggest this.

# End the preemption of state statutes

The most effective way to build on the work of the Restoring Justice for Workers Act is to end the preemption of state statutes. Congress could amend the FAA such that it no longer preempts state statutes singling out arbitration. Under this solution, states would be free to experiment with arbitration law and potentially derive new equitable solutions. [^realright1]
