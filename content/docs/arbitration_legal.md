## Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., 293 U.S. 449 (1935)

One Line Summary: power to grant a stay is not conditioned on power to compel arbitration. Existence of arbitration agreement is an equitable defense.

- [Court Opinion (Court Listener)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/102354/shanferoke-coal-supply-corp-v-westchester-service-corp)
- Majority Author:   Louis Dembitz Brandeis (9-0 unanimous)

{{< details "Pull quote (From Majority)" >}}
We think the Court of Appeals was clearly right in concluding that there is no reason to imply that the power to grant a stay is conditioned upon the existence of power to compel arbitration in accordance with § 4 of the Act.

## Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427 (1953) {id="wilko-v-swan"}

One Line Summary: The Securities Act overrides the Federal Arbitration Act (the judicial forum is a “a substantial right” and thus non-waivable).

- Status: **Reversed by [Rodriguez]({{< relref "/#Quijas-v-american-express" >}})**

{{< details "Pull Quote (from majority):" >}}
Two policies, not easily reconcilable, are involved in this case. Congress has afforded participants in transactions subject to its legislative power an opportunity generally to secure prompt, economical and adequate solution of controversies through arbitration if the parties are willing to accept less certainty of legally correct adjustment. On the other hand, it has enacted the Securities Act to protect the rights of investors and has forbidden a waiver of any of those rights. Recognizing the advantages that prior agreements for arbitration may provide for the solution of commercial controversies, we decide that the intention of Congress concerning the sale of securities is better carried out by holding invalid such an agreement for arbitration of issues arising under the Act.

> a federal court may not consider a claim of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally, but "may consider only the issues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate." Pp. 388 U. S. 402-404.

> Since the claim of fraud here relates to inducement of the consulting agreement generally, rather than in the arbitration clause, and there is no evidence that the parties intended to withhold this issue from arbitration, there is no basis for granting a stay under § 3. Pp. 388 U. S. 406-407.
{{< /details >}}


### Analysis

> Recognizing as "broad" a clause requiring arbitration of"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to" the agreement

> Holding that if the making of the arbitration agreement is an issue "the federal court may proceed to adjudicate it"

> Holding that contractual language "[a]ny controversy or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach thereof" is "easily broad enough to encompass" claim for fraud in inducement of contract

> The Prima Paint Court erred, however, in asserting that the FAA’s basis was “confined to” Congress’s interstate commerce and admiralty power. That assertion is flat out wrong: As we have seen, the legislative history shows that Congress placed primary reliance for enacting the FAA on its control over the procedures of the federal courts.

...any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration...

...unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute...

Section 2 is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary. The effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.

> When the FAA was passed in 1925, I doubt that any legislator who voted for it expected it to apply to statutory claims, to form contracts between parties of unequal bargaining power, or to the arbitration of disputes arising out of the employment relationship. In recent years, however, the Court "has effectively rewritten the statute," and abandoned its earlier view that statutory claims were not appropriate subjects for arbitration.

{{< details "Pull Quote (from syllabus):" >}}
Montana's first-page notice requirement, which governs not "any contract," but specifically and solely contracts "subject to arbitration," conflicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal meas- ure. Generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening § 2, see, e. g., Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281, but courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions

Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), an arbitration agreement that is ambiguous as to the availability of class arbitration does not manifest sufficient consent by the parties to submit to class arbitration. In a 5-4 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that the arbitration agreement between Varela and his employer, Lamps Plus, which contained only general language commonly used in arbitration agreements, did not provide the necessary contractual basis for compelling class arbitration.

In conclusion, the message of this article is: Watch this space. Members of the US arbitration ecosystem, whether they be willing members such as businesses or unwilling members such as employees and consumers, have very much been on a wild ride in the last few decades and the recent decisions, new legislation, and changing behavior by all involved means that this is only going to continue in the future.

    {{< details "Giles - Arbitration's Unraveling">}}
The 21st century has been a bleak one for proponents of collective litigation. The hegemonic rise of class-banning arbitration provisions has thwarted workers and consumers across the legal landscape, as the FAA has grown into a super-statute, frozen in a 1920’s conception of individual claiming.
But recent developments signal a thaw. Green shoots have appeared in Congress, which in 2022 amended the FAA for the first time in its history to exempt one important subset of litigation activity, possibly setting the stage for further rollbacks. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has explicitly rejected the assumption, widely held by lower courts, that the promotion of arbitration is a “favored policy” warranting the application of special rules of construction and procedure. The implications of this clarification are profound and should, by all rights, remove from the coverage of the FAA all claims by workers engaged in interstate commerce, among other effects.

    This particular paper suggestions that arbitration may not be as bad as often stated. It deeply mistates the history of arbitration (for example it cites Keating for the basis of a 'national policy of arbitration' - something the Court invented from whole cloth. Nonetheless, it makes some interesting points and is worth reading.

    {{< details "Jacobs - Often Wrong - Conclusion Pull Quote" >}}
Regardless of the “objective” reality of the fairness or lack thereof of arbitration, negative perceptions of the process already are “transform[ing] the reality faced by policy-makers”76 and influencing the development of the law regarding arbitration. For example, the AAA no longer will accept certain new consumer debt collection arbitration filings,77 and, as part of a settlement with the Office of the Minnesota Attorney General, the National Arbitration Forum will stop accepting or participating in the processing or administration of any new consumer arbitrations.

Instead, the use of arbitration was limited to business-to-business or management/union contexts. Indeed, to the limited extent that the possibility of such arbitration was considered by Congress in 1925, when it passed the FAA, those few who spoke on the issue made clear that they did not view such a use of arbitration as appropriate (pg 1636)`

In short, we think we know that the "'Haves' Come out Ahead" in ADR, as they do in litigation, but they may come out ahead in different ways or for different reasons. Therefore, as socio-legal scholars who have much to thank Marc Galanter for, it behooves the legal and social empiricists and reformers among us to collect the data we need so we can be more certain that the solutions we suggest will solve the problems that actually exist and not the ones we simply think exist. If the "'Haves' Come out Ahead" in both litigation and ADR, then where will we go next to achieve social justice in disputing?

While it stopped short of providing a uniform waiver analysis, the Court began to level the playing field between employees and employers bound by arbitration agreements by abolishing the prejudice requirement in waiver analysis. Employers who require job applicants to agree to mandatory arbitration begin the relationship with an imbalance of bargaining power. Employers’ use, as in Morgan, of strategic delays in invoking arbitration wrongly disadvantages employees and undermines the attributes of arbitration that Congress sought to invoke when it enacted the FAA. Removing the prejudice requirement was an important step toward safeguarding employee rights.

    {{< details "Schwartz - Jiggery-Pokery - Conclusion" >}}
Taken together, Justice Scalia’s major federal arbitration law opinions render unconscionability and public policy defenses to arbitration clauses virtually non-existent, while allowing corporate defendants to immunize themselves from class actions by the expedient of nesting a class action waiver in an arbitration clause. To achieve these results, Justice Scalia had to engage in a fair amount of jiggery-pokery on behalf of the long-lived five-Justice conservative bloc. One looking for principled conservative jurisprudence in Justice Scalia’s body of work should probably look elsewhere than his arbitration decisions. Justice Scalia abandoned his much-touted federalism principles early on, and eventually found in FAA cases an opportunity to transform arbitration agreements into “do-it- yourself tort reform.”83 While the phrase “jiggery-pokery” may well be long remembered, one can hope that Justice Scalia’s doctrinal jiggery-pokery in federal arbitration law will soon be overruled, gone and forgotten.

    {{< details "Schwartz - Correcting - Conclusion" >}}
Southland and its progeny are the result of bad statutory interpretation and even worse federalism. The historical evidence demonstrates that Congress never intended to preempt state law regulating arbitration agreements. To the contrary, the best interpretation of the FAA is that, by virtue of its savings clause, federal courts should normally be bound by state-law restrictions on arbitration enforcement. The evidence against Southland is so strong that it seems that no one defends it on the merits anymore: Southland lives on only because of the Court’s reluctance to overrule a statutory interpretation precedent, its desire to spread arbitration far and wide, or a combination of the two.

It is hard to imagine that this game of high stakes musical chairs would have been a welcome outcome to the Reagan anti-lawsuit reformers. Much as the arbitration revolution does reduce lawsuits (the primary goal of the anti-lawsuit movement), it carries an externality that the reformers’ carefully crafted legislative agendas did not: namely, the cessation of common law development in entire areas of the law. This externality, all else being equal, is as likely to prejudice the interests of conservatives as it is liberals; it all depends on where you are when the music stops.

On the closely debated issue of repeat player effects in arbitration, this study finds strong evidence of a repeat employer advantage and, more problematically, evidence of an advantage to employers in repeat employer-arbitrator pairings. The existence of an employer advantage in repeat employer-arbitrator pairings may reflect arbitral bias in some of these cases.

    {{< details "Knapp - Taking Contracts Private - Conclusion" >}}
The mandatory arbitration clause is thus sui generis, unlike any
other boilerplate provision that a stronger party might impose in a
take-it-or-leave-it contract. Every other provision-even a choice-of-
law or forum selection clause-can at least be tested by some court of
law, where the conflicting claims of freedom of contract and freedom
from economic oppression can be publicly weighed and assessed.
Enforcement of the mandatory arbitration clause, however, means
that neither the arbitration clause nor any other portion of that
adhesion contract can be so tested. Left unchecked, mandatory
arbitration will effectively "solve" the adhesion contract problem, to
be sure, but in much the same way as the Austrians in the 1938
Anschluss solved their Nazi problem: by handing over the keys to the
city.

    {{< details "Colvin - The growing use of mandatory arbitration - Conclusion" >}}
Mandatory employment arbitration has expanded to the point where it has now surpassed court litigation as the most common process through which the rights of American workers 12 are adjudicated and enforced. The rise of this problematic practice needs to be given much greater attention in employment policy discussions. If the Supreme Court does not reverse its trend of supporting mandatory arbitration and instead put the brakes on enforcement of class action waivers in its upcoming decision, it will be necessary for Congress to act in order to ensure that American workers have an effective means of enforcing the rights they have been promised.

186. There have been a smattering of area-specific legislative prohibitions against mandatory arbitration. See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 7 U.S.C.A. §26 (providing that an employee cannot waive his right to a judicial forum regarding a dispute that arises under the whistleblower protection section of the act); 10 U.S.C. § 987(e)(3), (f)(4) (voiding arbitration clauses in payday loan or consumer credit contracts, with the exception of residential mortgages and car loans, for members of the military or their families); 15 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(2) (prohibiting automobile manufacturers from imposing pre-dispute arbitration clauses in their franchise agreements with dealers); Truth In Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1639c (no mortgage lender may include a pre-dispute arbitration clause in its loan agreements); Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(e) (contracts requiring pre-dispute arbitration of whistleblower claims under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act not enforceable); Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-118, §8116(a), 123 Stat. 3409, 3454 (prohibits federal contractors who receive funds under the Act for contracts in excess of $1,000,000 from requiring their employees or independent contractors to arbitrate “any claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of sexual assault or harassment”). Numerous bills also seek broader overriding of the Supreme Court’s pro-arbitration jurisprudence. See, e.g., Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011, S. 987, 112th Cong. § 2929 (2011); Arbitration Fairness Act of 2009, H.R. 1020 § 4, 111th Cong, 155 Cong. Rec. H. 1517 (2009); Arbitration Fairness Act of 2007, S. 1782 § 4, 110th Cong, 153 Cong. Rec. S. 9144 (2007). The most recent version of this bill was introduced by Senators Al Franken (D-Minn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Representative Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) immediately after Concepcion was decided, and would prohibit class action bans in all consumer, employment, and civil-rights related contracts. See David Lazarus, Bill Aims to Restore Consumers’ Right to Sue, L.A. TIMES (Oct. 18, 2011), available at http://articles.latimes.com/2011/ oct/18/business/la-fi-lazarus-20111018. See also Consumer Mobile Fairness Act of 2011, S. 1652, 112th Cong. § 3 (2011). This bill, introduced by Senators Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Pa.), would void arbitration clauses in mobile phone contracts. While both the Arbitration Fairness Act and the Consumer Mobile Fairness Act were referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held hearings under the chairmanship of Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), neither bill cleared the committee. See Michelle L. Caton, Form Over Fairness: How the Supreme Court’s Misreading of the Federal Arbitration Act Has Left Consumers in Lurch, 21 GEO. MASON L. REV. 497, 527 (2014) (“Of the 139 bills introduced into Congress between 1995 and 2010 that sought to restrict or eliminate various uses of mandatory arbitration, only five were eventually passed into law.”).

189. See, e.g., Schnuerle v. Insight Commc’ns, Inc., 376 S.W.3d 561, 569, 573 (Ky. 2012) (“[U]pon application of Concepcion, we are now constrained to conclude that under contracts like the one now before us, which contain a class action waiver and also require disputes to be arbitrated under the FAA, the federal policy favoring arbitration preempts any state law or policy invalidating the class action waiver as unconscionable based solely upon the grounds that the dispute involves many de minimis claims which are, individually, unlikely to be litigated. . . . We, of course, yield as we must to the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of federal law.”); Willis v. Debt Care, USA, Inc., No. 3:11-cv430-ST, 2011 WL 7121456, at *7–8 (D. Or. Oct. 24, 2011) (“[T]he vast majority of numerous, smallvalue claims . . . for statutory violations will go unprosecuted unless they may be brought as a class due to the high costs associated with pursuing individual claims. . . . This court is sympathetic to the [plaintiffs’] argument. Regrettably, AT&T forecloses many consumer class actions which may provide the only recovery for wronged individuals.”); Porreca v. Rose Grp., 2013 WL 6498392, at *1, *15 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 11, 2013) (complaining that the decision to uphold the class action ban was “unappetizing” and “lamentable”); Dean v. Draughons Junior Coll., Inc., 917 F.Supp.2d 751, 765 (M.D. Tenn. 2013) (“While required by the FAA, this result strikes the court as manifestly unjust and, perhaps, deserving of legislative attention. . . . [I]n cases such as the one presented here, requiring impoverished individuals to arbitrate could effectively prevent them from exercising their rights as state citizens.”).
