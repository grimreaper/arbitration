- Arbitration was designed for entities of equal bargaining power [^1] [^2]

- A recalcitrant defendant can delay the start of meaningful proceedings a really long time. For example they can appeal the motion to compel and this would stay the civil court proceedings in the meantime[^3]

- Plaintiffs’ overall economic outcomes are on average 6.1 times better in federal court than in mandatory arbitration ($143,497 versus $23,548) and 13.9 times better in state court than in mandatory arbitration ($328,008 versus $23,548) [^4]

- It's harder to find a lawyer for cases which will be arbitrated. Contingency is riskier and clients can't be as easily pooled.[^4]

- Arbiters are not required to follow or even know the law. [^5] Only in narrow circumstances (in "manifest disregard") where the arbitrators must be found to have "understood and correctly stated the law but proceeded to ignore it." [^6]

To Be Sourced:


- The reason to do this is if the defendant is most likely in the wrong and just wants to delay paying as much as possible (or wear down the plaintiff). In true civil court the attorneys could have sanctions against them if they pointlessly delay the proceedings. Less so in arbitration.


- arbitors are not required to follow the law. There is almost no meaningful appeal even for substantive mistakes.

- arbitration is more informal and thus less procedural protection

- arbitration combined with class action waivers mean that each individually aggrieved person must sign up.

- Some highlights - Employee win rates in mandatory arbitration are much lower than in either federal court or state court, with employees in mandatory arbitration winning only just about a fifth of the time (21.4 percent), which is 59 percent as often as in the federal courts and only 38 percent as often as in state courts

- Differences in damages awarded are even greater, with the median or typical award in mandatory arbitration being only 21 percent of the median award in the federal courts and 43 percent of the median award in the state courts

- average outcome in mandatory arbitration is only 16 percent of that in the federal courts and 7 percent of that in state courts

- The mandatory arbitration–litigation gap in outcomes has a direct effect on the ability of individual workers to recover compensation for the injuries they have suffered.

- ""The fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that remedy.""
