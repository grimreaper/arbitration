# Introduction

Arbitration, as currently practiced, is a form of 'Rustic Justice' whose primary purpose to evade meaningful accountability for violations of contract or statutory rights. It has no place in consumer or employment contracts of adhesion.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly ignored the plain meaning of the statutes, congressional intent in writing the FAA, as well the standard rules of statutory interpretation effectively rewriting Title 9 to invent a "national policy favoring arbitration" as a form of “do it yourself-tort reform". [^jiggery] [^schwartzcorrecting] [^gilles5] [^sternlight] [^sacredcow4]

Arbitration is inherently a creature contract. The defining feature is not implicitly or speed but rather _party agreement_. As such most of this document is in generalities and discusses typical consumer and employment contracts. Furthermore, it is difficult to study because only a small fraction of awards are published and awards are only a fragment of the overall proceedings. [^ruminations1]

# General Information

- Arbitration, when passed, was designed for contract disputes between merchants, not statutory claims or between entities of unequal bargaining power. [^creeping1] [^comm] [^rustic] [^newarb2]$ In fact members of Congress expressly disavowed touching either consumer or employment contracts - and even went so far as to make that explicit with respect to employment. [^scaliaclass1] Julius Henry Cohen, the author of United States Arbitration Act,testified that the bill would be applicable in federal courts only. [^keating1] [^newarb4]

- Arbitration, as practiced, is unique to the United States [^cain2]

- The FAA was intended to be a procedural remedy available in the federal courts [^newarb1]. It was never intended by the enacting Congress to apply in state court. [^schwartzcorrecting] In fact, its constitutionality :"rests upon the constitutional provision by which Congress is authorized to establish and control inferior Federal courts"... and not solely upon "upon the exercise of the interstate-commerce". [^newarb5]


- A recalcitrant defendant can delay the start of meaningful proceedings a really long time. For example they can appeal the motion to compel and this would stay the civil court proceedings in the meantime[^coinbase]

- Arbitrators are not required to follow or even know the law. [^liptonlaw] [^privateknappcite2] Their rulings can be overturned only in narrow circumstances (in "manifest disregard") where the arbitrators must be found to have "understood and correctly stated the law but proceeded to ignore it." [^merrill]

- Despite not being required to follow (or know) the law they may have Absolute Immunity from statements they make. Importantly, this is true even if they are not operating in objective good faith. [^kentucky1]

- Overall, the evidence on whether arbitrators follow the law in their awards is inconclusive... analysis of statutes by labor arbitrators often is "cursory and conclusory." [^drahozal1]

- The lower probability of victory, the lack of class representation, and meager legal fees discourage attorneys from representing individuals in arbitration proceedings. This is particularly a problem where the fees will be paid on contingency (most employment and consumer cases). [^stone1] [^privateknappcite3] [^colvin2]

- Arbitration requires the waiver of jury trials.  While the jury is probably still out on this issue, there is a general perception that arbitrators give smaller awards than juries. [^privateknappcite1]

- When the contract limits remedies in other ways (reduced time to bring claims, limitations on injuctive relief, etc.) it is normally subject to Judicial review. Not so with arbitration. In fact, stepping "outside the bounds of the contract" are one of the few reasons arbitrator's awards can be vacated. [^privateknappcite4]

- An award can only be vacated if (1) it was procured by corruption or fraud, (2) evident partiality or corruption, (3) the arbitrator refused to hear relevant evidence, or (4) the arbitrator exceeded the power defined in the arbitration agreement. [^uscode1] These exceptions are interpreted narrowly with great deference given to the arbitrator. It may not overturned due to an error of fact, contract interpretation, or law. [^sacredcow3]

- In civil court the attorneys could have sanctions against them if they pointlessly delay the proceedings. Less so in arbitration.

- We have little empirical verification of the claims made both for and against arbitration and ADR, including positive assertions made about reduced cost, speed, and access to dispute mechanisms. [^galanterhaves3] The little empirical data we have consistently shows an anti-employee bias.  Basic questions such as the typical characteristics and outcomes of cases in employment arbitration remain to be definitively answered. [^colvinempirical1]

- Where the employee was self-represented the employee win rate was substantially smaller versus cases where the employee was represented by counsel. Award amounts are also smaller. [^colvinempirical7] This counters the argument that arbitration may reduce the need for attorneys.

# Historical Information

- Until the mid-1980s, arbitration was primary used for international contract disputes, collective bargaining agreements, and other large-scale commercial dispute resolution [^gilles2] [^gilles4]

- New York's arbitration act was passed in 1920 followed by the Federal Arbitration act in 1925 largely at the behest of commercial trade organizations. [^sacredcow1] They wanted resolution according the norms of the industry instead of by external law. [^sacredcow2]

- The Federal Arbitration Act was "is directed primarily toward settlement of commercial dispute" [^newarb2]

- Prior to the various arbitration acts of the mid 1920s the common law doctrine allowed for revocibility. [^newarb3]

# Employment

- Plaintiffs’ overall economic outcomes are on average 6.1 times better in federal court than in mandatory arbitration and 13.9 times better in state court than in mandatory arbitration ($328,008 versus $23,548) [^stone1]

- Employee win rates in mandatory arbitration are much lower than in either federal court or state court, with employees in mandatory arbitration winning only just about a fifth of the time, which is 59 percent as often as in the federal courts and only 38 percent as often as in state courts[^stone2] [^colvin2]

- Differences in damages awarded are even greater, with the median or typical award in mandatory arbitration being only 21 percent of the median award in the federal courts and 43 percent of the median award in the state courts[^stone2] [^colvin2]

- Average outcome in mandatory arbitration is only 16 percent of that in the federal courts and 7 percent of that in state courts [^stone2]

- Employee win rates are lower in cases based on employer promulgated procedures than in cases based on individually negotiated contracts. [^colvinempirical2]

- The mandatory arbitration–litigation gap in outcomes has a direct effect on the ability of individual workers to recover compensation for the injuries they have suffered. [^stone4]

- Repeat player employers fair better than first-timers. [^colvinempirical5] When they win against repeat player employers, employees recover only 11% of their claims. When they win in cases involving one-shot employers, they recover 48% of their claims. [^lisarepeat] [^colvinempirical5] [^note1]

- There is strong evidence for a repeat employer-arbitrator pairing effect in which employees tend to win less often and recover smaller amounts when the employer and the arbitrator are involved in multiple cases together [^colvinempirical8]

- Arbitrators that are picked by the employers more than once

- Arbitrators feel beholden to companies. Beneath every decision is the threat of losing business. [^silverprivate]

- Arbitrators habitually handle cases for the same corporate defendants over the course of four years. [^classdismissed2]

- Higher-level employees with resources for representation and use of the Commercial Arbitration Rules were more likely to gain favorable results than those lower-level employees who were subject to the Employment Arbitration Rules. [^galanterhaves2]

- Employees in nonunion contexts are still mostly one-shotters and are often unrepresented; also employees in arbitrations against repeat player employers do not fare as well as employees against nonrepeat player employers. [^galanterhaves2]

- The share of workers subject to mandatory arbitration exceedss 55 percent is growing. Among companies with 1,000 or more employees, 65 percent have mandatory arbitration procedures. 30 percent also include class action waivers in their procedures [^colvin1]


# Class Actions

- The ability to block class actions is the primary motivation to compel arbitration. It is rare for a company to try to force an individual lawsuit into arbitration but common for arbitration clauses to be invoked to block class actions. [^arbstudyfact1]

- The ban on class actions in particular makes it unlikely that many claims of corporate wrongdoing—particularly those that involve small sums for each in large groups of individuals—will ever be heard. As Justice Breyer opined, “Only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.” [^stone3]

- A commercial entity can cloister itself away from significant financial liability, as well as any correlative damages award meant to deter unsavory behavior [^classdismissed]

- "by far the most effective" tool to undermine class actions has been "arbitration provisions expressly waiving the right to any collective adjudication" [^gilles1]

- Most arbitration agreements do not require reasoned or even written opinions, punitive damages, or other remedial possibilities [^galanterhaves1]

- By avoiding class actions companies can also avoid FRCP §23(b)(2) injuctive relief. That is, they could avoid judicial orders to stop their behavior generally instead merely in specific cases.

# Consumer Credit

- Although proponents claim that arbitration decreases litigation costs for consumers, consumers often do not receive any benefit of reduced costs through forced arbitration. Only twenty-five consumers with claims of less than $1000 obtained relief in an AAA arbitration in 2010 and 2011. [^gilles6]

- CFPB consumer survey found that 79% of consumers didn’t know whether any credit card agreements they signed had an arbitration clause, and only 7% understood that they could not sue their credit card issuer if their contract did include such a clause. [^gilles6]

# Opt Out Clauses

Why do some contracts of adhesion have opt-out clauses?

- They reduce the chance that the contract will be held to be procedurally or substantially unconscionable

- They allow the employer to avoid e.g., JAMS minimum standards. In particular they allow the companies to argue that the arbitration is not "required as a condition of employment". [^jams1]

# Confidentiality

# Arbitration And The Law

- Because arbitration agreements are often confidential, and even when not they are not clearly reasoned or published they make it difficult to establish norms and ensure that equally situated persons are treated equally. [^creeping2]

- The effects of removing entire classes of litigation from the stream of the common law effectively halts the development of legal common law. [^gilles3] For example it is judge made rules that define permissible conduct under Title VII, the FLSA, and state employment laws. Private arbitration of these disputes allows defendant-employers to disregard such laws and prevent public development in regards to new behavior. [^gilles7]

# Federalism

- States usually determine their own contract law which can differ on damages, injunctive relief, availability of specific performance, and claims arising from contract law. However, the [Keating]({{< relref "arbitration_legal/#southland-v-keating" >}}) decision stripped state courts of the power to address arbitration provisions and their enforceability. [^keating2]

# Supreme Court Errors

- The [Keating]({{< relref "arbitration_legal/#southland-v-keating" >}}) decision that the FAA is intended to be substantive law rather than procedural law is wrong. [^newarb6]

# Possible Advantages

While arbitration is generally negative for both employees and consumers there is a little bit of silver lining.

## Speed of Resolution

- Arbitration is actually faster than litigation. Cases typically take around two to two-and-a-half years to reach trial but mean time to disposition for an employment arbitration case that resulted in an award was 361.5 days. [^colvinempirical3]  However, it is also important to recognize that most cases in both litigation and arbitration are settled before a final hearing. Furthermore much of the reason for the reduced length of resolution is that arbitration gives up important procedural rights.

## Fees

- Amongst the studied cases, the employer paid all arbitration fees 97 percent of the time, indicating that the employer-pays rule is generally being enforced in AAA employment arbitration cases. [^colvinempirical4] This is primarily due to state law requiring employers to pay for arbitration fees.

[^note1]: Research on the litigation process has also discussed the issue of repeat player advantages in that forum. However the arguments raised in that setting focus more on the ability of the repeat player to influence the institutions and rules of the process, for example through lobbying for or against statutory changes. Given that the parties are not directly involved in the selection of the judge in litigation, the same type of repeat player processes analyzed here for employment arbitration are not likely to be an issue in litigation and have not been subject of comparable statistical analysis in empirical studies of employment litigation.
