# Introduction

The Supreme Court has repeatedly ignored the plain meaning of the statutes, congressional intent in writing the FAA, as well the standard rules of statutory interpretation effectively rewriting Title 9 to invent a "national policy favoring arbitration" [^jiggery] [^schwartzcorrecting] as a form of “do it yourself-tort reform". [^sternlight]

# General Information

- Arbitration, when passed, was designed for contract disputes between merchants, not statutory claims or between entities of unequal bargaining power. [^creeping] [^comm] [^rustic] In fact members of Congress expressly disavowed touching either consumer or employment contracts - and even went so far as to make that explicit with respect to employment. [^scaliaclass1]

- Arbitration, as practiced, is unique to the United States [^cain2]

- The FAA was intended to be a procedural statute for the federal courts. It was never intended by the enacting Congress to apply in state court. [^schwartzcorrecting]

- A recalcitrant defendant can delay the start of meaningful proceedings a really long time. For example they can appeal the motion to compel and this would stay the civil court proceedings in the meantime[^coinbase]

- Arbiters are not required to follow or even know the law. [^liptonlaw] [^privateknappcite2] Only in narrow circumstances (in "manifest disregard") where the arbitrators must be found to have "understood and correctly stated the law but proceeded to ignore it." [^merrill]

- The lower probability of victory, the lack of class representation, and meager legal fees discourage attorneys from representing individuals in arbitration proceedings. This is particularly a problem where the fees will be paid on contigency (most employment and consumer cases). [^stone1] [^privateknappcite3]

- Arbitration requires the waiver of jury trials.  While the jury is probably still out on this issue, there is a general perception that arbitrators give smaller awards than juries. [^privateknappcite1]

- When the contract limits remedies in other ways (reduced time to bring claims, limitations on injuctive relief, etc.) it is normally subject to Judicial review. Not so with arbitration. In fact, stepping "outside the bounds of the contract" are one of the few reasons arbitrator's awards can be vacated. [^privateknappcite4]

# Employment

- Plaintiffs’ overall economic outcomes are on average 6.1 times better in federal court than in mandatory arbitration ($143,497 versus $23,548) and 13.9 times better in state court than in mandatory arbitration ($328,008 versus $23,548) [^stone1]

- Employee win rates in mandatory arbitration are much lower than in either federal court or state court, with employees in mandatory arbitration winning only just about a fifth of the time (21.4 percent), which is 59 percent as often as in the federal courts and only 38 percent as often as in state courts[^stone2]

- Differences in damages awarded are even greater, with the median or typical award in mandatory arbitration being only 21 percent of the median award in the federal courts and 43 percent of the median award in the state courts[^stone2]

- Average outcome in mandatory arbitration is only 16 percent of that in the federal courts and 7 percent of that in state courts [^stone2]

- The mandatory arbitration–litigation gap in outcomes has a direct effect on the ability of individual workers to recover compensation for the injuries they have suffered. [^stone4]

- When they win against repeat player employers, employees recover only 11% of their claims. When they win in cases involving one-shot employers, they recover 48% of their claims. [^lisarepeat]

- Arbitrators feel beholden to companies. Beneath every decision is the threat of losing business. [^silverprivate]

- Arbitrators habitually handle cases for the same corporate defendants over the course of four years. [^classdismissed2]


# Class Actions

- The ban on class actions in particular makes it unlikely that many claims of corporate wrongdoing—particularly those that involve small sums for each in large groups of individuals—will ever be heard. As Justice Breyer opined, “Only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.” [^stone3]

- A commercial entity can cloister itself away from significant financial liability, as well as any correlative damages award meant to deter unsavory behavior [^classdismissed]

- "by far the most effective" tool to undermine class actions has been "arbitration provisions expressly waiving the right to any collective adjudication" [^gilles]

# Consumer Credit

- Although proponents claim that arbitration decreases litigation costs for consumers, consumers often do not receive any benefit of reduced costs through forced arbitration.

# To Be Sourced:

- In true civil court the attorneys could have sanctions against them if they pointlessly delay the proceedings. Less so in arbitration.
