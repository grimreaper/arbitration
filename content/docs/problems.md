To Be Sourced:

- The processes to initiate arbitration can be ignored in some cases. You'd typically either file a 9 U.S. Code § 4 motion to compel or you would view failure to attend a a breach-of-contract and sue in civil court.

- That said, a recalcitrant defendant can delay the start of meaningful proceedings a really long time. For example they can appeal the motion to compel and this would stay the civil court proceedings in the meantime (see Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski).

- The reason to do this is if the defendant is most likely in the wrong and just wants to delay paying as much as possible (or wear down the plaintiff). In true civil court the attorneys could have sanctions against them if they pointlessly delay the proceedings. Less so in arbitration.

- arbitration tends to award lower judgements than the courts

- it's harder to find a lawyer as a result (contingency is riskier)

- arbitors are not required to follow the law. There is almost no meaningful appeal even for substantive mistakes.

- arbitration is more informal and thus less procedural protection

- arbitration combined with class action waivers mean that each individually aggrieved person must sign up.

- Some highlights - Employee win rates in mandatory arbitration are much lower than in either federal court or state court, with employees in mandatory arbitration winning only just about a fifth of the time (21.4 percent), which is 59 percent as often as in the federal courts and only 38 percent as often as in state courts

- Differences in damages awarded are even greater, with the median or typical award in mandatory arbitration being only 21 percent of the median award in the federal courts and 43 percent of the median award in the state courts

- average outcome in mandatory arbitration is only 16 percent of that in the federal courts and 7 percent of that in state courts

- The mandatory arbitration–litigation gap in outcomes has a direct effect on the ability of individual workers to recover compensation for the injuries they have suffered.

- ""The fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that remedy.""

- While this relates to employee vs employer arbitration - similar effects apply to consumer arbitration.

- mandatory arbitration and class-action waivers are two of the most pernicious terms allowed in modern contracts of adhesion and must be fixed.
